Voice Based Bill Collector - Code Explanation

Overview:
-----------
This project is a Streamlit web app that lets users create a grocery bill using voice commands or manual input. It recognizes spoken orders, extracts product and quantity, calculates the total, and can generate a PDF or read the bill aloud.

Main Components:
-----------------
1. **Imports:** Uses Streamlit for UI, SpeechRecognition for voice input, pyttsx3 for text-to-speech, pandas for data handling, and reportlab for PDF generation.

2. **Product Prices:** A dictionary holds product names and their prices per kg/unit.

3. **Speech Functions:**
   - `speak_text(text)`: Converts text to speech using pyttsx3.
   - `listen_for_voice()`: Listens to the microphone, recognizes speech, and returns the text.

4. **Parsing Voice Commands:**
   - `parse_voice_command(command)`: Uses regular expressions to extract product names and quantities from spoken text.

5. **PDF Generation:**
   - `generate_bill_pdf(bill_items, total_amount)`: Creates a PDF bill with all items and the total amount.

6. **Streamlit App (`main()`):**
   - Sets up the UI with columns for voice/manual input and bill display.
   - Handles adding items via voice or manual input.
   - Shows the current bill in a table.
   - Provides buttons to clear the bill, generate PDF, or read the bill aloud.
   - Shows product prices in the sidebar and gives usage instructions.

7. **Session State:** Uses Streamlit's session state to keep track of bill items between interactions.

Common Interview Questions & Answers:
-------------------------------------

Q1: What is the main purpose of this project?
A1: To allow users to create a grocery bill using voice commands or manual input, and to generate/download/read the bill.

Q2: How does the app recognize products and quantities from voice?
A2: It uses the SpeechRecognition library to convert speech to text, then parses the text with regular expressions to extract product names and quantities.

Q3: How are product prices managed?
A3: Product prices are stored in a Python dictionary, mapping product names to their price per kg/unit.

Q4: How is the bill displayed and updated?
A4: The bill is shown as a table using pandas DataFrame and Streamlit's dataframe display. It updates whenever items are added.

Q5: How is the PDF bill generated?
A5: The reportlab library is used to create a PDF with all bill items and the total amount, which can be downloaded.

Q6: How does the app read the bill aloud?
A6: It uses pyttsx3 to convert the bill summary text to speech and plays it.

Q7: What happens if the user gives an unrecognized voice command?
A7: The app shows a warning and gives voice feedback that no valid products were found.

Q8: How does the app handle manual input?
A8: Users can select a product and quantity from a form and add it to the bill.

Q9: What are some tips for using the voice feature?
A9: Speak clearly, mention both quantity and product, and use units like 'kg' or 'liters' for better recognition.

Q10: What libraries are essential for this project?
A10: Streamlit, SpeechRecognition, PyAudio, pyttsx3, pandas, and reportlab.

Q11: How is session state used?
A11: Streamlit's session state keeps track of the current bill items so the bill persists across user actions.

Q12: Can the app handle multiple items in one voice command?
A12: Yes, it splits the command by 'and' or commas and parses each segment.

Q13: How is the total bill amount calculated?
A13: By summing the total price of all items in the bill.

Q14: How can the user clear the bill?
A14: By clicking the "Clear Bill" button, which resets the bill items in session state.

Q15: How is the UI structured?
A15: The UI uses Streamlit columns for input and bill display, with a sidebar for product prices and markdown for instructions.
